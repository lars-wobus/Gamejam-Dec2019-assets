# Gamejam-Dec2019-assets

The secondary repository for the TUD game jam 2019 was mainly used to store .blend files.
The primary project can be found [here](https://github.com/ChristianK-TUD/Gamejam-Dec2019).
Unfortunately this one is still marked as private to not violate any license.
To show at least some results, the content of the README file from the main repository was copied. Just go on with reading!

## Summary

In the 3rd game jam inside the faculty of science in Dresden, ten groups of 3-5 people came together to develop games.

From Friday to Sunday evening our team was developing a hybrid, containing RPG elements from board games as well as AR functionalities provided by Vuforia and Unity.

### Topics

There was neither a specific topic nor any regulations about the type of game.

## Details

- Date: 30th November to 1st December 2019
- Location: Faculty of Science - TUD (Dresden, Germany)
- Team Name: SuddenlyAR
- Team Size: 4

## Goals

The players main goals are observing crime scenes, collecting valuable items, following clues as well as identify and killing one of the existing monsters. For this a compendium was created, where the player itself or another player can retrieve more information about the land and their dangers.

## Rules

- Cards containing QR codes are randomly placed on top of a desk, except for the hazard zones, where monsters live
- The player must flip cards one by one
- The player must observe 3d assets by scanning QR codes with his smartphone
- The player must pick the correct items before entering and confronting one of the monsters
- The player must hurry up, and perhaps make assumptions, before the timer has expired

## Controls

- The player must line up his smartphone camera with the QR codes
- Observed items can be taken, by touching on the screen
